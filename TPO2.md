The desert, which already occupy [approximately] a fourth of the Earth's land surface, have in recent decades been increasing at an alarming [pace].

沙漠，大约占领了地球四分之一的地表，近几十年来正在以令人震惊的节奏增长。

The expansion of desert-like conditions into areas where they did not previously exist is called desertification.

将类似沙漠的条件扩大到之前从未出现过的地区叫做沙漠化。

It has been [estimated] that an additional one-fourth of the Earth's land surface is threatened by this process.

人们估计大约还有四分之一的地表正在沙漠化中。

Desertification is [accomplished] primarily through the loss of stabilizing natural vegetation and the subsequent accelerated erosion of the soil by wind and water.

沙漠化的完成主要通过损失稳定的自然植被和随后的被风和水侵蚀的土壤。

In some cases the loose soil is blown completely away, leaving a stony surface. In other cases, the finer particles may be removed, while the sand-sized particles are accumulated to form mobile hills or ridges of sand.

一些情况下这些松散的泥土被完全从石质的表面吹走。直到沙粒大小的微粒累计形成小山丘或者沙脊。

Even in the areas that retain a soil cover, the reduction of vegetation typically results on the loss of the soil's ability to absorb substantial quantities of water.

甚至在有土壤覆盖的地区，植被的减少通常导致了土壤吸收大量水的能力的下降
